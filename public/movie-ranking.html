<h2>My Top Three American Movies</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Lord of the Rings trilogy</h3>
<p>It's a fantasy style movie and I love all things fantasy plus the worldbuilding is great.</p>

<h3>Edge of tomorrow</h3>
<p>Badass Characters with an interested plot.</p>

<h3>Valerian and the City of a thousand planets</h3>
<p>I love the graphics, the cgi and the end credits song which was sung by Rihanna.</p>
